## 🎨 Design Philosophy  
> *"Good design is invisible — it lets the content shine."*  

The Sift prioritizes **clarity and trust** over flashy gimmicks. Every design choice was validated against three pillars:  
1. **Readability** – Typography, spacing, and layouts reduce cognitive load.  
2. **Accessibility** – Color contrast, font choices, and UI modes ensure inclusivity.  
3. **Credibility** – Clean presentation builds trust in journalism.
